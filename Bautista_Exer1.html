                    My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 22. Aside from learning various OOP techniques, I was able to create and develop a game with a working interface and some graphics.

                    My favorite GE so far is MATH 10 because I was able to appreciate how Mathematics is involved in almost every aspect in our world. Additionally, it did not involve a lot of heavy computations so it was really enjoyable.

                    I think my favorite language as of now is java since using this PL I was able to create my first working game with graphics and user interface.
